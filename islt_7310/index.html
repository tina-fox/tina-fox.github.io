        <h2>Hi! I’m Tina Fox, and I’m a student in the Learning Technologies and Design master’s program.</h2>
        <p class="hello">I am also an instructional media designer specializing in graphic design and motion graphics for the University of Missouri’s Office of E-Learning. As part of the Course Design and Technology team in Columbia, Missouri, I collaborate with instructional designers, faculty, and other media designers on a wide range of projects, including online and blended courses, videos, handouts, and course quality reviews. It is my goal to help faculty create engaging, meaningful learning experiences for their students and to ensure that students have the best possible experience with their courses. Being an online student in the Learning Technologies and Design program has helped me see things from a student perspective and become a more informed and empathetic media designer. </p>
