     Hi! I’m Tina Fox, and I’m a media designer specializing in graphic design and motion graphics in the University of Missouri’s Office of E-Learning. I’ve been developing instructional media since 2008, so I’m pretty comfortable working with HTML and CSS already, but it’s always good to review! I’m also getting ready to graduate this spring from the Learning Technologies & Design master’s program. I hope to review best practices for web development in this course and work with GitHub—it’s my first time using it. In my free time, I play cello in a local amateur orchestra, run, read, garden, walk my border collie, Oliver, and play board games with my husband. I’m looking forward to learning with all of you this semester!
